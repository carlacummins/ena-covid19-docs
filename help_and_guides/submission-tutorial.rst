SARS-CoV-2 Submissions Workshop
========================================================================

Introduction
------------
In this workshop, we will step through the available options to submit SARS-CoV-2 data to the European 
Nucleotide Archive using example data. For a complete submissions guide, please see 
`here <sars-cov-2-submissions>`_.

Metadata Model Guide
====================
Before submitting any data, it is important to understand
the structure of our 
`metadata model <https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/general-guide/metadata.html>`_.
This model is used, not only for SARS-CoV-2 data, but data from across the tree of life. In this 
short video, I will touch on the importance of each element of the model and what data/metadata each
object holds.
